what is Inheritance ?
> Inheritance is core concept in OOP, it is similar as real world inheritance. Like in real world children 
  inherite many things from their parents for example looks, habits, medical issues and properties. 
> In Java also one class can inherite another class by doing this that base class will get access to every thing
  of super class including it's variables, classes and methods. 
> In Java we have 2 types of inheritance
    1) Single level inheritance
    2) Multi level inheritance
> Single level is very clear a class extends another class. 
> Multi level is suppose class we have 3 classes GrandParent, Parent, Children, Parent class inherit GrandParent 
  class this is single level inheritance and Children class inherit Parent class now because Parent class also 
  have inherited another class this Children class will get all the properties and methods of both Parent and 
  GrandParent class, this is Multi Level Inheritance.
> To perform inhertance we just have to use `extends` keyword and have to mention the class name which we want 
  to inherit.
  
  class Children extends Parent{}

> Important thing to keep remember is Java does not support multiple inhertiance in simple word in Java a class 
  can not extends or inherit more then 1 class at a time. You have to do jugad if you want to achive this but 
  by default Java does not supports Multiple Inheritance.
