what is abstract ?
> abstract is keyword in Java. It can be used with class and method. 
> It is used to add abstraction on classes and methods. 
> Adding abstration to method means we don't need to provide defination/logic for our method once we declared it
  as abstract. To define abstract method we need class to be abstract. The logic and defination of method will be
  provided by the class which inherite this abstract class it is mandatory for base class to add implementation 
  of all the abstract methods of super class.  The obvious question is when we don't want defination/logic inside 
  a method then why are we writing it, this is right but in certain condition it is useful suppose you want To
  make sure that which ever class implements your class should have some methods and those methods need dynamic
  implementation. For example you have a BankAccount class and you want every base class to implement credit and
  withdrawn methods and we know these two operations has different behaviour in different types of BankAccounts. 
> Syntax for defining abstract method is:
  protected abstract void withDrawn();
> As I said to define abstract methods we need to mark/make our class also abstract. 
> We can not create object of Abstract classes. It can be inherited and base class must have to provide 
  implementation for all the abstract methods of super class. 
> Abstract class can also contains normal methods. 
> Syntax for abstract class is:
  public abstract class class_name{}
