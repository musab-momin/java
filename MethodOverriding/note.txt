what is method overriding ?
> As we know Java supports inheritance becuase of inheritance base class gets all the methods of parent class. 
  Now if think all the method names which were used in super class can not be used in  base class that will create
  amiguity right! To solve this problem Java has a feature called method overriding, If base class has a method 
  which has same name as super class method the base class method will override parent class method. In other 
  words base class method will provide it's own defination so when you create a object of base class and tries to 
  call that method it will call the method of base class. This is called method overriding.
> But what if you want to call the super class method, you can do this by using `super`. We can call or use any 
  property or method of super/parent class using super. In our case will do something like this: 
   super.method_name();
> Object will call which class method it is decide on runtime by Java. That is why method overriding also known 
  as RuntimePlymorphism.
