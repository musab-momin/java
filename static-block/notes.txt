What is static block ?
> Before understanding static block we must first understand what is block. block is container which contains 
  multiple line of code. Then what is static block, Static means something which belongs to class not to the 
  object of class. So a Static block is a block which belongs to class and often use to set values to 
  static variables of class. 
> We can have multiple static blocks they got called in the order they are present inside the class.
> Static blocks get's called even before the constructor. That is because whenever we create object for class 
  2 things happens under the hood:
  1) Class gets loaded
  2) Object has been instantiated
  NOTE: 1 step happens only for the first object creation, if you create multiple objects of same class the class 
        will not gets load every time. It will be loaded only for the first time.
> After the class loads it calls static blocks that is the reason why static blocks gets called even before 
  constructor method and only get's called for one time. 
> We can invoke the static block or called load your class without creating object. For that we have one inbuild
  class named as `Class` this clas has one method called `forName()`. If you call this method it will load your 
  class and your static block will get called.
