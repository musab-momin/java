what is(are) wrapper classes ?
> When we say Java is a Object Oriented Programming language. It is 99.9 percent correct claim, you must be 
  wondering why, well because Java support primitive data types like byte, short, int, boolean, char, float and 
  double. These primitive means they are for computers. We don't need Heap memory or objects to use them they are
  directly stored inside stack memory. 
> In Java there are some other libraries which works only with objects. So what would you do If you want to work 
  with those libraries and want to store some variale which are of type int, float or boolean etc. 
> To solve this problem Java gives a wrapper class for each primitive datatype. These classes are known as wrapper
  classes.
> We have 2 concept related to wrapper classes: 
    1) Boxing: 
        > When we assign a primitive type variale to it's wrapper class this is known as boxing.
          int x = 5;
          Integer xObj = new Integer(x);
        > We can also directly assign primitive variables to wrapper classes without using the object creation 
          syntax. In that case boxing will happen automaticaly that's why we say autoboxing.
          int x = 5;
          Integer xObj = x;
    2) Unboxing:
        > This is a reverse of boxing, When we try to assign wrapper class obj to primitive datatype it is called
           Unboxing and unlike boxing unboxing happens automatically that is why we refer to this as autounboxing

           Integer xObj = 45;
           int x = xObj;
