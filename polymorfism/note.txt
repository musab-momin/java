what is polymorfism ? 
> polymorfism means `many forms`,  is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows one interface to be 
  used for a general class of actions. In simpler terms, polymorphism allows you to perform a single action 
  in different ways.
> We have 2 types of polymorfism in Java: 
    1) CompileTime Polymorphism: Method overloading is a example of it. During the compile type Java will decide 
       which method is going to be called. As you know in method overloading we have 2 methods with same names and
       each will perform different action. 
    2) RunTime Polymorphism: Method overriding is a example of it. Java compile the code and during the Runtime 
       it is been decided which method to call in case of overriding.
