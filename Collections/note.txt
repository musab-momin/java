What is JCF ? 
> Java Collection Frameword is a essential part of core java. It provides a set of classes to work store and 
  use data in different structures.
> Collection is the root interface for collections hierarchy.
> JCF provides 3 things to us: 
    1) Interface: Abstract datatypes which represent differnt types of collections. (List, Set and Map).
    2) Classes: Concrete classes which provides implementation for all interfaces (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap).
    3) Algorithms: Some basic Algorithms to perform of collections (sorting, searching).
> We have couple of major/main interfaces in JCF which are: 
    1) Collection Interface: Root interface of entire hierarchy.
    2) List Interface: Ordered collection which allows duplicate element. 
    3) Set Interface: Unordered colleciton which does not allow duplicate element.
    4) Queue Interface: Collections that order elements in a specific order for processing.
    5) Map Interface: Collection of key,value pair elements.
> For each major interface we have some common implementation classes which are mostly and widly used. 
    1) List Interface:
        -ArrayList: Resizeable array implementation. Good for ranomd access and iteration.
        -LinkedList: Double LinkList implementation. Good for fast insertion and deletion.
    2) Set interface: 
        -HashSet: Uses hash table for storage. Fast lookup but no ordering.
        -LinkedHashSet: It also uses hash table for storage. Fast lookup and also maintain insertion order.
        -TreeSet: Same as other two but it also sort element according to their natural order.
    3) Map Interface: 
        -HashMap: Uses hash table for storage. Fast lookup with keys but no ordering.
        -LinkedHashMap: same as HashMap but it maintain insertion order.
        -TreeMap: Same as other two but it also sort elements according to their natural order of keys.
