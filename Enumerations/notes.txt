What is enum ? 
> enum are special feature in Java. enums are used to define constant values. which can be used to represent a 
  fixed set of related values, such as days of the week, months of the year, or directions 
  (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST).
> It is a special type use to define pre set constant values. 
> enum is also class it also inherit Object class and we can override Object class methods like toString(). 
  We can also define our methods and Even Constructors. enum also allow us to define fields/properties inside it.
> Those properties we can pass them to Constructors and It will set those values to constants. which we have 
  defined. 

  public enum SeverityLevel {
    LOW(1, "L"),
    MEDIUM(2, "M"),
    HIGH(3, "H"),
    CRITICAL(4, "C");

    private final int levelCode;
    private String shortForm;

    SeverityLevel(int levelCode, String shortForm) {
        this.levelCode = levelCode;
        this.shortForm = shortForm;
    }
  }

> In the above code we have 2 instance variables. LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and CRITICAL these are constant object of 
  SeverityLevel enum. To set instance values to these constant objects we have parameterised constructor also. 
> We have naming convention for enum constants they should be typped in uppercase.
