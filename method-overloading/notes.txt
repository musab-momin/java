What is method overloading ? 
> Methods which has same name but different type or different number of parameter is called method overloading.
> Imagin you have a class Calculator and you want to add 2 numbers, so do that you created a method named add()
  it takes 2 parameter of type integer add(int x, int y). Yeah, problem solved! but later on you decided you 
  want to add 3 numbers so you update your method and make like this add(int x, int y, int z) but now 
  you can't use it for adding 2 numbers. That's is when method overloading somes handy, you can say that we can 
  create another method which takes 3 numbers and add them, well you can but think for that you have to maintain
  2 different method which does the same operation. It is not something optimal or ideal. 
> A method can be overload If they must have same name but different number of parameter or different type of 
  parameter, In our existing example if we create another add() method which takes 2 parameters but 1 parameter 
  is of type double that also a method overload because that method has different type of parameter 
  add(double d, int i).
> We can also do overloading with static methods, yes that is totaly possible.
> We can also mix static methods with normal method in overloading, for example you can have 2 static methods and
  1 normal method with same name and different parameters but this is not recomemded.
> We can also do this with abstract methods and also with constructor and we already discussed this in 
  class and method lecture.
