What is casting ?
> As we know Java is staticly typed language. which means we have to specify the type of variable before 
  initialisation. 
> What if you define a variable in type x and later on you want to convert in type y, is it possible! umm,
  yes it is possible and when you do this type conversion explicitly (by your own) then this is known as 
  type casting. 
> All though changing of variable type is possible but you can not convert any type of variable to any other type
  in the case of primitive value.
> Let's just check the example of type casting, 
 
  int i = 56;
  byte b = (byte) i;

What is conversion ?
> As it's name suggest, when you convert the type of varaible it is known as conversion but wait what's the 
  difference then. The difference in conversion you don't do this by your own or explicitly, conversion is something
  which happens implicitly (in other words java did this for you).
> example

  byte b = 126;
  int i = b;

> here you assigned the byte to int and you didn't mentioned it like you did in type casting (byte).
> Another example could 

 int i = 10;
 double d = i;

> You will get the result as 10.0 as java convert int into double for you implicitly. 


What is type propotion ?
> This is also as it sounds like you are getting promotion and when you get promoted you go from low to high.
  simillarly in java can promot you to higher data type like from short to int and from int to double. 
> But java does not randomly promote any variable the condition is during the runtime or after some operation 
  if the result is getting out of the range of operational variables to prevent program from crashing Java does 
  this type propotion.
> Let's take an example suppose you have to type variable 
  byte a = 10; byte b = 30; and you have performed multiplication with these two variables 
  a * b it will give you a result which is 300 and 300 is out of the range of byte so java will promot the result
  variable into int.
