what is array ? 
> Array is fixed length collection of similar type of variables, items or object. 
> We have 2 syntax to define array. 
    int[] arr = {2, 3, 4};
    int[] arrObj = new int[5];
> As array is of fixed sized in 1st sytanx it will take the length for array from how many elements does we 
  insert in the start. The 2nd sytanx is of defining object, in this case we must have to tell java the size of 
  array. 
> Array is not a primitive type it is a reference or instance type that's why it's content does not saved of 
  stack memory it is saved on heap memory and stack will have it's reference. 
> We can not add more elements then defined length and we can not have multiple types of elements inside a 
  single array. 
> We don't have any method to add elements into array, we have to use the index for adding element into array. 

What is multi dimensional or 3D array? 
> If we have single or multiple array(s) inside of array it is called multi demensional array.
> We can have n number of dimension in single array. 
> To define the dimension of array we have to use `[]` square brackets. Like for normal or single dimensional 
  array we use single pari for square brackets [], so for two dimensional array we have to use 2 paris for square 
  brackets and for three dimensional array we have to use 3 paris for square brackets and it's go's on.
> Like in a single dimensional array we must have to define the length of array but for other dimensions we have 
  a choice to define the length on initialisation or later on, it's up to us.
  int[][] twoDimensionalArr = new int[4][];
  > In above example we didn't define the length for second dimension. It means for each index of outer array
    we can have any length of array. 
    twoDimensionalArr[0] = new int[3];
    twoDimensionalArr[1] = new int[4];
    twoDimensionalArr[2] = new int[5];
    [[2, 4, 6], [20, 40, 60, 80], [200, 400, 600, 800, 1000]]
  > As we can see, we have length of 3, 4 and 5, I mean different length of array at each index.
  > This type of array is called Jacked array but if you define the lenght of other dimensions also then it will
    be normal multi dimensional array.
