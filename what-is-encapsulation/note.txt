what is encapsulation ?
> Encapsulation is one of the core concepte of Object Oriented Programming. Normally encapsulation is mean
  `Restricting direct access to something`. In programming also it works in the same way. Consider a class 
  which has some properties and methods and we as a programmer it is our duty to make sure these properties and 
  method should be private to that class only but It does not mean any thing outside this class can't access 
  these things no they can but they need to ask that class for it. In real world also if you own something and 
  someone wants that thing they ask you and you gave to them.
> In Java we have some access modifier public, private, protected etc. will discuss this later for implementing
  privacy in class we make our properties and method as private. You just have to give the private access modifier 
  to anything which you want to make private. 
> But what if you want this to be access by outer class or world. To do so we make methods to set the values for
  our property called setters and to get properties we also have method which we call as 'getters()'.
> In case of methods if you made method private it will not available outside that classs. Even if some other
  class inherit class that base class also does not have any access to this private method.
